
I solved the problem in a certain way which did not meet the requirements of the question.
I realized my error quite and late and due to poor decision making, I have a broken program.
Although I think you will realize that I have understood the idea of coroutines. It was mainly
due to my own carelessness that it is what it is.
I hope you wont be too strict towards my work here. Thanks! Moving on....

The main test document:

Needless to say, the first thing I would test would be a line  having all components:

input : %+123.456hd
the output will be: '%+123.456hd' : '%+123.456hd' yes

We should test a blank line, for a sanity check.
Output: '' : Warning! Blank line.

Start an almost line without '%'
Input: +d
Output:'+d' : '+' no, extraneous characters 'd'

Have a line with no specifier:
Input: %hh
Output: '%hh' : '%hh' no

Check for double charachter lengths:
Input: %lld
Output: '%lld' : '%lld' yes

Check that the character after '.' in precision is a number or '*'
Input: %*.hd
Output: '%*.hd' : '%*.h' no, extraneous characters 'd'

Check that '*'s work fine
Input: '%*.*d' : '%*.*d' yes

Checkt that '*'s and numbers arent supposed to be together
Input: %*1.2d, %1.*2d
Output: '%*1.2d' : '%*1' no, extraneous characters '.2d'
	'%1.*2d' : '%1.*2' no, extraneous characters 'd'

And extraneous characters count should also be tested, which are done through the tests here.

Thank you!
