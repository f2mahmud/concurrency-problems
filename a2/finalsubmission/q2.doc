I have created the ExampleType class as a template for the binsertsort program. It contains a char and an int.
To calculate than ExampleType a > ExampleType b, we need to check if char a.y > b.y, if it is then a>b. 
Otherwise we check whether if int b.x > a.x. If it is so, then b > a. With that in mind, some testing scenarios
are as follows:

1) the blank case:
input : 0
output: /*blank line*/
		/*blank line*/
		
2) General Case:
input:4 d-3 c-4 a-5 b-6
output: 
d-3 c-4 a-5 b-6
a-5 b-2 c-4 d-3 

This is a general comparison where the sorting is already taken care of by the chars, regardless of the int
value being carried.

3) Handled by the ints:
input: 5 a-3 a-4 a-5 a-6 a-2 
output: 
a-3 a-4 a-5 a-6 a-2 
a-6 a-5 a-4 a-3 a-2 

Since all the chars are the same, the ints are compared. As you can see, they are all descending.

4) Single input:
input: 1 a 3
output: 
a-3
a-3

Pretty simple scenario, just to see if it can handle just one item

5) Bad input
input: 4 a 3 n 4 m 3 l 5 (through the command line)
output: 4 a 3 n 4 m 3 l 5

Just to show the error handling mechanism of the program.
